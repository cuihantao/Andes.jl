# Andes.jl

The Julia interface for ANDES.

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/com/cuihantao/Andes.jl/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.com/cuihantao/Andes.jl)

## Introduction

`Andes.jl` is the Julia interface for ANDES, a power system simulation tool for symbolic modeling and numerical simulation.

`Andes.jl` provides APIs through `PyCall` and `Conda` for calling ANDES from Julia.

## Installation

Install `Andes.jl` with

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("andes")
```

### Customize Python Environment

If you have installed andes in an existing Python environment and do not want to reinstall it from conda, you can configure it in Pycall.

You can manually set the Python path with the following commands in Julia:

```
ENV["PYTHON"] = "... path of the python executable ..."
# ENV["PYTHON"] = "C:\\Python37-x64\\python.exe"        # example for Windows
# ENV["PYTHON"] = "/usr/bin/python3.7"                  # example for *nix
# ENV["PYTHON"] = "/home/name/miniconda3/envs/andes"    # example for conda
Pkg.build("PyCall")
```

Check out the [documentation](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl#specifying-the-python-version) of `PyCall.jl` for more details.

## Usage

`Andes.jl` exposes all Python APIs under `andes.py`. Use the package with

```julia
using andes
[ Info: Precompiling andes [93a26e3f-343a-4ab9-b467-a68c67574964]
```
All subsequent usages can be made to `andes.py` in the same way as in Python.

For example, to run power flow for `kundur_full.xlsx` (assume exists in the current directory), run

```julia
julia> system = andes.py.run("kundur_full.xlsx")
Parsing input file <kundur_full.xlsx>
Input file kundur_full.xlsx parsed in 0.0768 second.
-> Power flow calculation with Newton Raphson method:
Power flow initialized.
0: |F(x)| = 14.9283
1: |F(x)| = 3.60859
2: |F(x)| = 0.170093
3: |F(x)| = 0.00203827
4: |F(x)| = 3.76414e-07
Converged in 5 iterations in 0.0063 second.
Report saved to <kundur_full_out.txt> in 0.0007 second.
-> Single process finished in 0.1666 second.
